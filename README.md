# data-preprocessor
Automates repetitive boring SpreadSheet tasks using Python. Read and tidying messy data.

## Project Description
Allows you to read and modify Excel spreadsheet files. My colleagues have boring tasks of go through thousands of rows and pick out just a handful of them to make small edits based on some criteria to compare certain data based on different spreadsheets. I designed a diagram of workflow to visualize a process. I still working on the project i hope it helps you too.

## Pseudocode
- Convert excel files to dataframes
- Set every sheet into different dataframes
- Specify data type for columns.
- Convert nan-values to False
- Check if cell contains certain string
- Export DataFrame to Excel

## Credits
Of course I'd like to give special thanks to inspire me @sven-bo.
